## What were you doing before joining Le Wagon's batch #30 in Paris?

After getting my engineer degree, I worked as Product Manager in the high tech industry on the development of various accessories (mobile protection shell, headphones, loudspeakers...) before taking a gap year to focus on a personal project about music. During this gap year, I was really curious. I started spending a lot of time each day on [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com) or to code static web pages with HTML and CSS by re-using cool ideas from [CodePen](http://www.codepen.io). I first heard about coding bootcamps at the time when speaking with friends about my new interest in programming and tech. They told me to have a closer look at Le Wagon and move to the next level!

## How did you stay motivated throughout the course?

The curriculum is very well crafted, the teachers are passionate and the learning platform makes it easier day after day to grasp new concepts and get closer and closer to autonomy. Above the syllabus, the atmosphere was great, not only with my classmates but also with former alumni on Slack. Every day, we were helping each other, sharing tips and even getting answer from previous alumni on the Slack channel for those of us who were more advanced on the day's challenges. This combination of good syllabus and passionate community gives you an incredible boost and the desire to surpass yourself from the first day to the last one where you present your project in front of a large audience.

## What was the transition out of Le Wagon like ?

It was not easy because the pace of the program is really intense and then courses stop overnight, all of a sudden! But it's also a great test for you to really think about what you want to do next. Le Wagon opens you different doors, you can follow the entrepreneur's path and keep working on your MVP trying to get some traction, you can start working as freelance and look for clients or you can look for a developer position. During the bootcamp it's going really fast and you don't necessarily have the time to ask yourself all these questions about your next moove. In my case, I just kept coding. Just like that. Just for me. I just kept working on personal web applications. My idea was to keep up with the pace of the bootcamp and consolidate all the skills I had learned during those 9 weeks.

## What’s the coolest opportunity (career-wise) that you’ve had since graduating Le Wagon?

Two months after Le Wagon, I started applying to junior Full-Stack developer positions and I finally got hired  by [Drivy](https://www.drivy.com), an amazing startup [re-inventing the car rental industry in Europe](https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/27/drivy-grabs-35-million-for-its-car-rental-marketplace/). I am very excited about my new job and I'm really grateful that the team trust me on my first developer's position. The Tech and Product teams are great, only passionate and brilliant people. I am in the perfect position [to keep improving my programming skills and work on a product I love](https://drivy.engineering/story-of-a-junior-developer-at-drivy/).
