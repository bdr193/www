## What led you to enroll with Le Wagon?

After spending one year in Berlin, working for a digital start-up, I realised my technical background was too light to keep on working for tech companies and get cool job offers. For me, learning to code was a pre-requisite to really have an interesting profile. At that time, I didn't have much time to start all over and learn on my own. Le Wagon's bootcamp was perfectly fitting my needs: a product-oriented bootcamp with no compromise on coding best practices.

## How did you hear about the FullStack program?

I was searching for European coding schools on the internet and Le Wagon popped up first (thanks to good SEO practice :)). Of course, I then investigated a bit and discussed with former students. They just confirmed the opinion I had by looking at their website, reviews, demo days on Youtube, and by reading their curriculum.

## Did you encounter any difficulties or challenges during the bootcamp?

The learning pace is very fast! From the very beginning until the end, it's intensive and challenging. Sometimes, it feels like you haven't completely "digest" one learning block but you have to move on to the next one. But then, the structure of the program is really smart, and based on repeating concepts week after week. So if you stay motivated and enthusiastic, you end up getting the big picture.

When I joined [Save](https://www.save.co/) as junior backend developer after the program, I realised that my knowledge of code was deep enough to be productive and efficient even in a team of experienced developers. Of course, I was not an expert in Algorithmics, bash scripts, or noSQL databases. But thanks to hard work and experienced mentors, I learned very fast, being already familiarized with important software engineering concepts and coding best practices after Le Wagon.

The rest are details you'll get back to, and remember: as a developer you're part of a strong open-source community, you're never alone with your problems.

## Why would you recommend Le Wagon over other similar learning programs?

Not only Le Wagon is giving you good coding skills, relying on stable technologies, but I also love their teaching approach: you learn and work as a group, and the more you try to help each other, the more you understand code. Their teachers are amazing, their community is amazing. And it's a community you belong to for life!

## What's the best thing in Le Wagon's experience?

Sebastien Saunier :)

## What did you do immediately after the bootcamp?

I did freelance first, on small projects. I didn't want to jump into a very big project directly, I needed to gain more self confidence as a programmer. Then, I joined one of the most promising french start-ups, [Save](https://www.save.co/), as a Ruby on Rails backend developer. The team is amazing, and I'm really proud to be part of this adventure. Coming from a business school and ending up backend developer in 3 months. What a ride!

## What are you up to now?
Keep on coding!
