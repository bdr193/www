## What were you doing before Le Wagon?

I studied computer systems in university, but by the age of 37, I had not done much in the area. For ten years, I worked in an insurance company, Império Bonança, as an automobile expert. What made me work there for so long was the flexibility the job allowed. But in 2014, I felt many changes in the company and in the business itself so I started looking for other options.

An opportunity to work in a typography company appeared, so I said goodbye to the big insurance company.

Unfortunately, the move was too hasty and, in the end, the job fell through with the typography company.  I was left with nothing. It was a very difficult time, and after more than a year unemployed I was not sure what I wanted to do. Then, I became a computer science teacher. I spent a year and a half teaching kids, which was a completely different experience.  When the contract finished, I went on unemployment with some guarantees.

## And how the idea to study programming come about?

I decided to evaluate what I wanted to do and I went back to square one. In December 2016, in the middle of some research, I discovered Le Wagon. I sent an email then spoke with Shannon, Lisbon’s Driver, about my background and the refresh I needed to get back into the job market.

## Was it easy to get in?

The course was about to begin and there was the possibility of joining the group in April (four months later), but I did not know what would happen in the meantime. I insisted on joining the batch that began in a little under two weeks, finished the prerequisites, and I got in.

## What were the essential challenges of the course?

The bootcamp is not easy - it is exhausting. It is nine weeks of daily intensity that does not allow you to recover from everythink you learned the day(s) before. It's knowledge on top of knowledge: I often felt burned out, due to the speed of content being pushed on you.  It’s full immersion.  A few times asked myself, 'what am I doing here?'.  But you come to the end of the program, and when you can actually build a product, however small it may be and everything works, it is super rewarding.

## Was it easy to enter the job market after the course?

I was a bit reluctant about this whole process because I doubted I could get any benefit out of a nine-week course. In the end, I did not even have to look for work: on Linkedin I had many recruiters and companies contacting me with opportunities.

I finished the course in late March, and started working as a junior developer on July 4th. In my case, the inexperience in programming was not relevant when compared to soft skills and what I could learn.

## What was the biggest surprise of this life changing process?

Recognition and, in the days after much work, a break. Now, I feel like I'm on a project with a awesome team and there's nothing that could convince me to leave. Everyday I am growing and learning, it is part of being a programmer. I never thought I could turn my life around like this.  I often feared things would go wrong. I'm so happy with how everything has worked out.

As front end work is more visual, I can see customers enjoying the product, which is such a pleasure.  So much that even during periods when the work is harder, I do not even realize that I am opening my computer. Unconsciously, I end up doing certain things because it gives me pleasure. And that says it all.
