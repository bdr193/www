Have you ever felt lost when thinking about what you should do with your personal finances? Everyone speaks about saving and investing but no one has ever really explained to you why interest rates matter, how you’re supposed to “diversify” your finances, or what an “emergency fund” is.

The founder of [Finimize](https://www.finimize.com/) encountered this problem himself, as he could not figure out what to do with his own savings: how / where / in what to invest? What does all the financial jargon we see in the FT actually mean in layman’s terms?

To solve this, [Max](https://www.linkedin.com/in/berlinmax/?ppe=1) created Finimize: a daily email which explains finance concepts in simple terms, contextualised with current financial news and is now building Finimize MyLife, a free financial planning app.
