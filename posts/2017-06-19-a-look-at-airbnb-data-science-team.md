As a consumer company, data represents the voice of Airbnb's users at scale, and Data Scientists play the role of interpreter. Data Scientists at Airbnb face unique challenges due to the dynamics of their two-sided marketplace, the online and offline components of their platform and the vast surface area of their product.
