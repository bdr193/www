Understanding your users' behaviors, needs and motivations is key to design a kickass web product. ðŸ‘Š

This workshop will be led by [Charlotte Breton Schreiner](https://charlottebretonsch.com/), Senior UX Architect.

Whether you are an entrepreneur building a prototype, a developer crafting a product during a hackathon or a designer who wants to test ideas with end users, this workshop is for you.

We will cover accessible user research methods that anyone can apply without any prior UX knowledge. During the workshop, you will have the opportunity to try some of these methods with the other participants and realize how powerful taking a user-centered approach can be. ðŸš€
