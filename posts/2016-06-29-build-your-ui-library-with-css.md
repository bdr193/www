description: "In this workshop, you will learn to code navbars, buttons, cards, dropdown-lists, banners, badges, etcâ€¦ and other UI components that you retrieve in most web apps. To do that, we will cover lots of cool CSS techniques and patterns by reproducing components from existing websites (Product Hunt or Medium). Positioning techniques, flexbox, transitions, filters, etc.. you'll learn a lot of crazy CSS stuff, we promise!"
