[Made.com](https://www.made.com/) was launched in April 2010 by Ning Li, [Julien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julien-callede-9925202/) and Chloe Macintosh.

The company's mission is to make high-end, designer furniture accessible for all.

Made.com cuts out the middleman and links consumers directly with the designers. This allows the organization to provide high-quality, made-to-order, cool-designed furniture straight to consumers at low prices.

Seven years after its creation, the company is nearing £100m in sales and has more than 400 employees, making it one of the most successful online furniture retailers.
