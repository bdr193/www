Have you noticed those cute little green scooters around Barcelona? They are [YUGO](https://www.getyugo.com/), a Barcelona based startup that's revolutionizing mobility by providing a moto sharing service which works like Bicing, but with electric scooters and without stations.

If you're curious about the minds and the story behind them, join Le Wagon and YUGO community for a nice talk about entrepreneurship, smart cities and new friendly ways to improve mobility.
